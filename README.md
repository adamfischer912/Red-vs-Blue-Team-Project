"# Red-vs-Blue-Team-Project"  
- Summary - I was able to attack a vulnerable VM in my environment and was able to gain root access to the machine. Then, I switched to the blue team and used Kibana to review the logs that were taken while I was conducting the red team operation. I was able to extract hard data and visualizations.  
- Role - Pentester and SOC Analyst  
- Tools - Kibana, nmap, hydra, crackstation, msfvenom
